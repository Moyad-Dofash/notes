                  		    <li>CSS syntax <br>
                  		        the first part is called the selector (the html elment) you wanna apply the rules on you for class use <em>.classname</em> to id use <em>#idname</em> <br>
                  		    	 the second is the called the declaration block between those brackets <mark>{</mark> <em>hello</em><mark>}</mark> 
                            <li>DOM, or Document Object Model, is a tree structure with a node for each HTML element,piece   of text, image, and any other object in the web page.
                              <li>   Selectors are one part of the CSS ruleset. They indicate which HTML element(s) the rule is for.
                               <li>  Declaration blocks are the other part of the CSS ruleset, they say how the rule will modify the elements indicated by selectors.
                               <li>  CSS rules are composed of a selector followed by a declaration block.
                                <li> type is the simplest kind of selector. It indicates the name of one type of HTML element (such as em or li).
                               <li>  class in HTML is an attribute that groups elements together that you want to have the same style.
                               	<li>id is an attribute that must be unique to a single element, used to identify it.
                               	Type selectors are used to apply a style to a particular type of HTML element, like h1 or body. Type selectors are written using just the type name.

                             <li>   Class selectors are used to set the style for multiple HTML elements that have a particular value for the class attribute. You can name a class anything you want! Class selectors are written with a dot before the class: for elements such as  the class selector is .blue.

                              <li>  ID selectors are used when the style is being applied to one HTML element, which has to have an id attribute. There can be only one element with a particular id on a page. You can also choose any name you want for an id, just like a class. ID selectors are written using a # sign: for an element such as (div id="sidebar"), the id selector is #sidebar.

               <ol>
              
                  <li>p tag is used to describe the functionality of the text its important to use for paragraphs</li>
               
                  <li>sub and sup stand for "subscript" and "superscript". Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work; and these are really useful for science and math, like writing <sub>x2+3x+4 = 1</sub> or chemical formulas like H<sub><mark>2</mark></sub>O</li>
              
                  <li>however mark tag is used to mark and highlite any <mark>text </mark >that you want </li>
              
                  <li>(em) and (strong) — Emphasis.<br>
                  By default, text inside (em) is displayed as <em>italic</em>, and text in (strong) is displayed as <strong>boldface</strong>.<br>
                
                  <li>(p) — Paragraph.
                  Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.<br>
                
                  <li>(br) — Line break. (empty)
                  A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.<br>
                
                  <li>(sub) and (sup) — Subscript and superscript.
                  Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.<br>
                
                  <li>(mark) — Highlighting.
                  Not very often used, but it's <mark> kind of cool.</mark></li>

                  background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of the
                  element's influence. Input elements, like <input type="radio" /> and
                  <input type="checkbox" />, are also inline-level content.

                  <li>To open new tab when type a hyperlink tag (a) you should use the atterbiute  <a href="https://www.instagram.com" target="blank">u should use attribute (target="blank")</a>
                  <li>To add image use the tag (img src="" alt="" ) but its like br its void element doesnt have a closing tag src stands for source and alt stands for alternative to describe the image in words
