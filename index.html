                  <li>p tag is used to describe the functionality of the text its important to use for paragraphs</li>
               
                  <li>sub and sup stand for "subscript" and "superscript". Originally, HTML started out as a tool for scientific and academic work; and these are really useful for science and math, like writing <sub>x2+3x+4 = 1</sub> or chemical formulas like H<sub><mark>2</mark></sub>O</li>
              
                  <li>however mark tag is used to mark and highlite any <mark>text </mark >that you want </li>
              
                  <li>(em) and (strong) — Emphasis.<br>
                  By default, text inside (em) is displayed as <em>italic</em>, and text in (strong) is displayed as <strong>boldface</strong>.<br>
                
                  <li>(p) — Paragraph.
                  Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.<br>
                
                  <li>(br) — Line break. (empty)
                  A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.<br>
                
                  <li>(sub) and (sup) — Subscript and superscript.
                  Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.<br>
                
                  <li>(mark) — Highlighting.
                  Not very often used, but it's <mark> kind of cool.</mark></li>
              
                  <li>This span is an <span class="highlight">inline-level element</span>; its
                  background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of the
                  element's influence. Input elements, like <input type="radio" /> and
                  <input type="checkbox" />, are also inline-level content.
